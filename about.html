          <h1>What We Do?</h1> 
          <p>
             We help keep people well informed about the natural calamities and misfortunes going on around us, so that when in danger they know what to do and be safe. We also help our people during calamities, our website acts like a medium through which people can stay connected, once people are taken to the nearest shelter place we log their data into our website so their family or loved ones know that they are safe. conversely if your family member is in such a place where there are disasters happening and you are not sure if they are safe you can contact us and their names will be diplayed in our "help us find section".

          <p>
             We reach out to organisations, colleges, offices and hospitals which are not functioning during the time of crisis, as their workplace would be of great use to the people whose lives have been shook by the disaster. Managements and corporations could take a subscription such that 1% of people' salaries in those companies will be reserved for crisis situation.

           <h1>What does a volunteer do?</h1>
           <p>
             You can volunteer to help people by being on spot volunteer if you live near the active crisis location, by ensuring that people are properly evacuated and are moved to a safe shelter place. Once they are safe volunteers report the people so that their familes know that they are out of danger and also by helping us find missing people who are stuck in the middle of the crisis. Help us ensure that the donations are reached to the people properly.
